# Parts

## Overview

This year, BJWZ-China has made contributions of 2 suceed basic parts, 4 composite parts and 2 biocontainment system. For the composite parts, the team has engineered comprehensive genetic circuits comprising operators, distinct ribosome binding sites (RBS), and signal peptides， linkers, which are designed to enable direct utilization by future iGEM participants. Additionally, a suicidal system derived from BNU-China and BJWZ-China-2024 has been integrated to enhance the biosafety of the engineered system, thereby mitigating the potential risks of genetically modified organisms impacting natural ecosystems.

## Basic Part

This year, BJWZ-China targeted PFAS pollution using DhaA dehalogenase. After reviewing recent studies and comparing dehalogenases, DhaA was chosen for its compatibility with chassis strains, broad substrate range, high stability, and engineering potential. Its advantages—including computational design, chemical modification, and AI-optimized advances—have reshaped enzymatic catalysis research. Integrating synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, DhaA is poised to drive breakthroughs in PFAS bioremediation and green synthesis. Additionally, the fluoride ions released from PFAS are transported out of the cells by fluoride ion transporters, thereby enhancing the toxicity tolerance and treatment efficiency of engineered bacteria.

## Composite Part

This year, BJWZ-China assembled several new Composite Parts that serve as core modules for constructing genetic devices in our project design. These modules can achieve specific functions such as gene expression regulation, metabolic pathway mediation, and biosensing. By modularly combining functional elements, they provide flexible components to achieve our project goals, enabling the development of complex biological functions in our engineered strain.

At low fluoride concentrations, the riboswitch adopts a "closed" conformation, thereby preventing the transcription or translation of the downstream gene(s). When fluoride concentration increases, F⁻ binds directly to the aptamer domain of the riboswitch, inducing a conformational change that derepresses and thereby initiates the expression of the downstream gene(s). <br> **123-131 bp:** RBS BBa_B0034 | Succeed | 131 |

## Biocontainment system

Since a type II antitoxin-toxin (TA) system is functioning effectively as a suicidal system for killing our manufactured leakage microorganisms, we were inspired by last year’s contribution and build the exact same sequence pathway using the parts listed below.

| Registry Code | Part Name | Profile | Allocation | Status | Length(bp) |

As the antitoxin of the type II TA system, MazE prevents cell death by directly binding to the toxin MazF and inhibiting its activity. <br> **305-316 bp:** GS Linker; <br> **317-334 bp:** 6×His; <br> **348-359 bp:** RBS; <br> **366-701 bp:** MazF; MazF is the core toxin protein of the classical toxin–antitoxin (TA) system in bacteria, which forms a functional pair with the antitoxin MazE and plays a key role in cellular stress responses and gene regulation. In normal conditions, MazF is bound by MazE at a 1:1 ratio, forming an inactive MazE–MazF complex that maintains cell viability. Upon exposure to nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress, or antibiotics, MazE is degraded by proteases such as ClpAP and Lon, thereby releasing the active form of MazF. <br> **710-737 bp:** rrnB T2 terminator. <br> **Other sequence:** Intergenic Sequence. | Failed to function | 737 |

When it is 37℃, the stem-ring structure of is the RNA thermometer opened, thus, RBS is exposed, the MazE(antitoxin protein) could be normally expressed and can bind MazF(toxin protein) protein makes MazF ineffective. <br> **70-315 bp:** MazE; <br> **316-327 bp:** GS Linker; <br> **328-345 bp:** 6×His; <br> **359-370 bp:** RBS; <br> **377-712 bp:** MazF; <br> **721-748 bp:** rrnB T2 terminator. <br> **Other sequence:** Intergenic Sequence. | Succeed; However, in our engineered bacteria, leaky expression occurred, and no transformants were obtained. | 748 |
| BBa_25Y0Q84D | araC-ccdB | The kill switch controlled by L-arabinose |1-28 bp: T7 terminator；<br> **32-910 bp:** araC; AraC represses at araO1 but activates pBAD with L-arabinose, initiating ccdB. <br> **1056-1221 bp:** araBAD promoter; In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC binds as a monomer to araO1 and araI1, forming a DNA loop that inhibits RNA polymerase binding to the pBAD promoter, thereby turning off transcription with minimal leaky expression. In the presence of L-arabinose, the sugar binds to AraC, causing it to adopt a dimeric conformation that binds to araI1 and araI2, recruits RNA polymerase, and initiates high-level transcription. <br> **1253-1558 bp:** ccdB; CcdB inhibits DNA replication without lysis, sparing native microbes.
