### [**I. Coding sequence of ccdB.**](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4657001)
---
ccdB encodes toxic protein (CcdB), which acts as a DNA gyrase toxicant, locking the DNA gyrase together with broken double-stranded DNA, ultimately promoting bacterial suicide. In our initial design, this gene has been optimized and adapted to our chassis strain E. coli MG1655 at the time of synthesis.

### [**II. Coding sequence of crcB**](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2073013)

Excess fluoride is toxic for bacteria. After the degradation of PFOA, fluoride would be released simultaneously. To prevent the E. coli killed by excess fluoride, we transfected Crcb(La2) gene into E. Coli.
Crcb(La2) is one of fluoride transporters - integration with the plasma membrane - able to expulse fluoride from E. Coli.
Sequence and Features.


### [**III. Coding sequence of araBAD promoter**](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K465700)
---
araBAD promoter is an E. coli promoter that is tightly controlled by inducer L-arabinose and repressor Arac.

### [**IV.Coding sequence of DhaA**](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2286002)

DahA31 is a multi-site mutant of haloalkane dehalogenase(DhaA), and its mutations are located in 135 (I→F), 176 (C→Y), 245 (V→F), 246 (L→I), 273 (Y→F). Compared with DhaA, DhaA31’s activity to 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) has been increased by 32 times. Because this enzyme is from Rhodococcus rhodochrous, the original sequence is suitable for expression in prokaryotic cells. However, this sequence is codon-optimized for petunia and is more suitable for plant system. In addition, the N-terminal of the enzyme fused an N-terminal ER-targeting signal peptide which is beneficial to stable protein expression and cell wall localization.
