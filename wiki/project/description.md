## Problem

Short-chain PFAS (carbon chain length C4-C8) belong to a category of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS exhibit extremely high biological stability and have a very broad range of health impacts. PFAS may increase the risk of heart disease in humans and can also adversely affect child development. Studies have shown that PFAS are closely associated with adverse health effects such as high cholesterol, reduced immunity, and the induction of liver cancer. The adverse effects of PFAS on the ecological environment are equally severe. PFAS can lead to the death of organisms in water, soil, and air, thereby disrupting the ecological balance. PFAS can bioaccumulate in higher trophic level animals, leading to toxin accumulation within their bodies. Furthermore, PFAS may also cause inhibition of aquatic plant and animal growth, fisheries loss, food poisoning, environmental pollution, etc.

PFAS are known as "forever chemicals" because their carbon-fluorine bonds are extremely resistant to natural degradation. Short-chain PFAS are more soluble in water and mobile than long-chain ones, and have been widely detected in water bodies, soil, and organisms globally: In the soil of China's coastal provinces (such as Guangdong, Fujian), PFAS pollution is severe, with some regions exhibiting high ecological risk for PFOS (long-chain), but the accumulation trend of short-chain PFAS is also rising; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found co-contamination of groundwater with short-chain PFAS (such as PFBA) and 1,4-dioxane at multiple sites (e.g., Tinkham Garage), threatening drinking water safety.

Currently, pathways for treating short-chain PFAS are lacking, and some traditional methods have limitations. For example, activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis are effective for long-chain PFAS but exhibit low efficiency for short-chain PFAS; foam fractionation requires the addition of surfactants (like CTAB) to promote the removal of short-chain PFAS, and experiments show reduction to below 8 ng/L, but large-scale application costs are high. Meanwhile, the primary means of detecting PFAS relies on chemical analysis using large instruments (such as LC-MS), which also entails high costs. In summary, both the detection and degradation of PFAS currently require high costs and are relatively inefficient, thus creating an urgent need for novel technologies to address short-chain PFAS.

## Our Inspiration

PFAS contain a large number of carbon-fluorine bonds, making the most effective means of degradation the breaking of these C-F bonds and the precipitation of the released fluoride ions. We aim to find a solution using engineered *E. coli* to construct an integrated PFAS "detection-degradation" system. When PFAS is present, the *E. coli* automatically executes a "luminescence warning" and "initiates degradation." Through blue light excitation, it emits green fluorescence indicating the presence of PFAS in the wastewater, subsequently breaks the C-F bonds on the PFAS, transports the resulting fluoride ions out of the cell, and precipitates them with calcium ions in the environment, thereby completing the degradation of PFAS.

## Our Solution

Based on the above principle, we have established an experimental project hoping to achieve some effect in the degradation and detection of PFAS.

We have linked a simplified and modified PFAS-responsive promoter to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and a PFAS dehalogenase gene (dhaA).

When the environmental PFAS concentration reaches a certain level, the *E. coli* will emit green fluorescence upon excitation light exposure, while the dehalogenase cleaves the C-F bonds of PFAS intracellularly, producing fluoride ions.

After fluoride ions are generated, a fluoride ion transporter protein exports them outside the cell, where they form a precipitate with calcium ions in the environment. Simultaneously, the *E. coli* emits red fluorescence under daylight exposure, indicating that the transporter protein has begun expression.

Additionally, the arabinose operon is used to control the expression of the ccdB toxin protein, ensuring the maintenance of biosafety measures.

## Our Goals

We hope to achieve the following three expected outcomes through this project.

1.  In water samples containing PFAS, the engineered bacteria will emit green fluorescence.
2.  Degrade PFAS, forming calcium fluoride precipitate, with the engineered bacteria emitting red fluorescence.
3.  After adding an appropriate concentration of arabinose, the engineered bacteria complete suicide.

We hope to achieve these goals and contribute to the efforts of others.
