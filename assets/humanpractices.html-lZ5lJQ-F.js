These substances can inhibit plant growth in water bodies and affect humans through the food chain, increasing the risk of heart disease. Traditional detection relies on large instruments (such as LC-MS), and degradation requires complex conditions like high temperature and high pressure, making it unsuitable for low-cost widespread adoption. Therefore, BJWZ-China has developed a simple PFAS detection and degradation system based on engineered E. coli. Facing numerous challenges in experiments and large-scale implementation, we realized the limitations of relying solely on our team&#39;s internal insights. Ultimately, we collaborated with numerous professors from Beijing Normal University and professionals within wastewater treatment plants to improve our project.<br> To implement the project, we partnered with the iGEM team BNU-China, who focused on assisting us with initial project topic selection, standard experimental operating procedures, and providing training on laboratory safety knowledge.<br> Our &quot;Human Practices&quot; plan aims to connect people dedicated to wastewater treatment. By consulting with experts from various fields, we strive to make our project as efficient and responsible as possible in practical applications.</p><h2 id="value" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#value"><span>Value</span></a></h2><p>We are committed to integrating human practices into the engineering design process to achieve the best possible outcome for our product. We believe that for our product to be accepted by society and enter the market, it is crucial to understand the real-world needs and safety requirements of wastewater treatment. In addition to considering the opinions of end-users (wastewater treatment plants), we also want to value societal voices, as this helps refine the project to be as comprehensive and responsible as possible when it enters the real world. Therefore, we define the users involved in the project and relevant social groups as our stakeholders.<br> For every stakeholder influential in the development of wastewater treatment, we prioritize our core values, including public health, environmental safety, and innovation. We strive to integrate these values into our product, helping us resolve conflicts among them.</p><h3 id="_1-public-health" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-public-health"><span>1 Public Health</span></a></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, PFAS poses hazards to human health. Therefore, our team&#39;s goal is to propose a new approach to reduce the cost of PFAS detection and degradation, enabling better removal of PFAS from wastewater, thereby safeguarding public health. During consultations with personnel from wastewater treatment plants, we found that wastewater in many large industrial treatment plants contains significant amounts of PFAS, urgently requiring an efficient and low-cost method for detection and treatment. Furthermore, China invests substantial funds, manpower, and resources annually in wastewater treatment. This demonstrates that our project in China can not only solve public water safety issues but also bring strong economic benefits by reducing expenditures in this area.</p><h3 id="_2-environmental-safety" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-environmental-safety"><span>2 Environmental Safety</span></a></h3><p>Due to the unique chemical properties of PFAS, they easily adhere to soil particles, contaminating land resources, and also readily enter rivers and groundwater, causing water pollution and indirectly affecting human survival. They can also cause serious consequences in wildlife through the food chain, such as developmental deformities and loss of reproductive function. Therefore, we developed our project to degrade PFAS efficiently and at low cost, reducing its environmental harm. Simultaneously, to ensure that the E. coli we use does not leak and cause secondary environmental pollution, we equipped it with a suicide gene, ensuring that waste bacteria can be safely and harmlessly disposed of after use.</p><h3 id="_3-innovative-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-innovative-design"><span>3 Innovative Design</span></a></h3><p>As traditional treatment methods like chemical processing and physical adsorption are costly, complex, and time-consuming, we developed this novel biological treatment approach. The advantages of this method are its rapid action and built-in detection function, which can effectively monitor whether PFAS in wastewater has been treated to meet safety standards. Additionally, adopting this technology can significantly reduce treatment costs, ensuring good cost-effectiveness alongside high efficiency. Moreover, it is highly compatible with the existing biological treatment sections of major wastewater treatment plants.</p><h2 id="stakeholders" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholders"><span>Stakeholders</span></a></h2><p>When identifying our project&#39;s stakeholders, we considered both surface-level and underlying aspects. On the surface, the primary beneficiaries of our project are personnel in wastewater treatment plants, as this technology can lower treatment costs and simplify the visualization of PFAS levels in treated effluent. From a potential benefit perspective, all living beings on Earth would benefit. This is because the technology can effectively prevent PFAS from transmitting their pollution through the food chain in the environment, thereby ensuring the normal survival and reproduction of wildlife and the safety of public water.</p><h2 id="experimental-journey" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#experimental-journey"><span>Experimental Journey</span></a></h2><p>During brainstorming, team members conceived the topic of wastewater treatment. Currently, with technological advancement, various new pollutants emerge, including PFAS. Through communication with employees of wastewater treatment plants, we learned about the specific processes of biological wastewater purification. This helped us determine potential user needs based on underlying goals and facilitated the project&#39;s industrial application. Thus, our solution gradually took shape. We also enhanced our project&#39;s visibility through educational outreach activities.</p><h3 id="_1-identifying-the-problem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-identifying-the-problem"><span>1 Identifying the Problem</span></a></h3><p>PFAS, a new type of pollutant, is called &quot;forever chemicals&quot; due to its extreme persistence. Literature research found that PFAS is resistant to high temperatures, difficult to degrade, waterproof, oil-resistant, prone to environmental accumulation, easily diffuses through water systems, and contaminates soil and groundwater. Furthermore, existing technologies have high processing costs and long cycles. Therefore, our team wanted to use synthetic biology techniques to solve this problem. We attended a lecture by Professor Liu Shuwen at the synthetic biology laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Professor Liu explained many benefits brought by successful synthetic biology experiments. He also told us about reasons why synthetic biology often struggles to yield results, for example, many synthetic biology products function correctly in the lab but often encounter issues like large-scale bacterial death when scaled up to tons or more. This enlightened us to consider not only feasibility in the laboratory but also to anticipate potential failures when scaling up production.</p><h3 id="_2-solving-the-problem" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-solving-the-problem"><span>2 Solving the Problem</span></a></h3><p>After the initial plan was formed, we contacted professors in the professional field. Through online meetings, professors provided modification suggestions on project details, enhancing the project&#39;s feasibility and professionalism. Subsequently, during holidays, team members went to the School of Life Sciences at Beijing Normal University for training. We learned theoretical knowledge such as protein properties and structure, enzyme functions, understood high-end techniques like chromatography testing, and practiced operations like plasmid DNA extraction and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This provided a theoretical and practical foundation for our subsequent experimental operations. We visited the Gaobeidian Reclaimed Water Plant to understand firsthand how a wastewater treatment plant operates. We toured various processing sites, including the biological purification tank and membrane filtration workshop. The biological purification section was our focus, identified as the optimal point for integrating our project. We also consulted on-site staff about handling discarded microorganisms and found that the UV disinfection stage could coordinate with our designed suicide gene to prevent environmental pollution from bacterial leakage. Finally, we inquired about the PFAS content in their plant&#39;s wastewater and learned that PFAS levels are actually not high in such domestic wastewater treatment plants; PFAS is primarily found in some industrial wastewater. This provided valuable direction for our project&#39;s implementation, prompting us to reconsider which treatment plants our project would be most practically valuable for.</p><h3 id="_3-expanding-outreach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-expanding-outreach"><span>3 Expanding Outreach</span></a></h3><p>We used a public WeChat account to promote the hazards of PFAS and the rapid development of synthetic biology. Such popular science articles can not only educate the public but also enhance project visibility, providing a premise for future promotion and implementation.</p><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary"><span>Summary</span></a></h2><p>Through multifaceted efforts, we completed a comprehensive closed-loop &quot;Human Practices Work.&quot; Through interactions with various individuals helpful to the project (wastewater treatment plant staff, BNU professors, etc.), we improved the project&#39;s feasibility. Despite facing many problems, we strived to propose suitable solutions for different issues to ensure our product meets public health needs, safeguards environmental safety, and promotes innovation. This relentless pursuit of excellence contributed to the successful development of our project.</p>',24)])])}const d=t(o,[["render",r]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/humanpractices.html","title":"Human Practices","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Human Practices Overview Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as \\"forever chemicals\\" due to their persistence, are difficult to degrade in the environment and are w...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Human Practices\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-09-16T07:24:31.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/BJWZ-China2025/humanpractices.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"BJWZ-China"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Human Practices"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Human Practices Overview Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as \\"forever chemicals\\" due to their persistence, are difficult to degrade in the environment and are w..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-09-16T07:24:31.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-09-16T07:24:31.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1756377794000,"updatedTime":1758007471000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alex198142","username":"Alex198142","email":"3122260860@qq.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alex198142"},{"name":"Alex1981420911903114","username":"Alex1981420911903114","email":"123648927+Alex1981420911903114@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alex1981420911903114"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":4.5,"words":1350},"filePathRelative":"humanpractices.md","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,h as data};
