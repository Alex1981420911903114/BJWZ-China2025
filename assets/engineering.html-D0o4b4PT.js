Introduction</span></a></h2><p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), due to their &quot;forever chemical&quot; properties, are difficult to degrade in the environment and are widely found in drinking water and soil. PFAS pose significant hazards to human health and the ecological environment. Traditional detection relies on large instruments (e.g., LC-MS), and degradation requires complex conditions such as high temperature and high pressure, which are unsuitable for low-cost widespread adoption. This project aims to design a <strong>simple and easy-to-operate integrated &quot;detection-degradation&quot; system</strong>, utilizing engineered <em>E. coli</em> to achieve visual detection and preliminary degradation of PFAS.</p><h2 id="ii-experimental-materials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ii-experimental-materials"><span>II.

We aim to achieve active and efficient decomposition of PFAS by artificially regulating the expression of this protein in <em>E. coli</em>. For the pET-28a(+) plasmid, we inserted a commonly used suicide gene, <em>ccdB</em>, with its expression regulated by arabinose, allowing artificial control of bacterial suicide to ensure no potential for environmental release. Additionally, into the pET-21b(+) plasmid, we also inserted the <em>CrcB</em> gene, with its expression regulated by fluoride ions. CrcB is a transmembrane protein capable of transporting fluoride ions out of the cell.
