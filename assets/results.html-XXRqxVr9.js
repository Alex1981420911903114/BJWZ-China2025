Concentration gradient experiments verified that these genes can indeed be expressed in DE3. Furthermore, our suicide plasmid system for ensuring biosafety also functioned well, achieving experimental controllability and meeting iGEM requirements.</p><h2 id="next-steps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps"><span>Next Steps</span></a></h2><h3 id="discussion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discussion"><span>Discussion</span></a></h3><p>The Significance of Successfully Constructing Engineered E. coli for PFAS TreatmentNowadays, PFAS pollution is a very serious environmental problem, posing great hazards to human health and the ecological environment, and there is currently no very effective solution. The construction of engineered bacteria provides a new approach for detecting and degrading PFAS, innovatively integrating the PFAS detection and degradation system into one, allowing the engineered bacteria to autonomously handle PFAS without additional regulatory steps. Due to the powerful suicide system and fully controllable mechanisms for regulating target protein expression, these modified bacteria are safe enough not to spread into the environment. We look forward to contributing to PFAS treatment, reducing health and environmental problems caused by PFAS pollution, promoting ecological civilization construction, and building a healthy life together.</p>',8)])])}const p=t(a,[["render",i]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/project/results.html","title":"Results","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Results Experimental Results Conclusion We successfully constructed the dhaA + crcB protein expression plasmid capable of decomposing PFAS and transporting fluoride ions out of ...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Results\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-10-04T11:09:46.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/BJWZ-China2025/project/results.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"BJWZ-China"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Results"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Results Experimental Results Conclusion We successfully constructed the dhaA + crcB protein expression plasmid capable of decomposing PFAS and transporting fluoride ions out of ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-10-04T11:09:46.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-10-04T11:09:46.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1756377794000,"updatedTime":1759576186000,"contributors":[{"name":"Alex198142","username":"Alex198142","email":"3122260860@qq.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Alex198142"},{"name":"Alex1981420911903114","username":"Alex1981420911903114","email":"123648927+Alex1981420911903114@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Alex1981420911903114"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.62,"words":186},"filePathRelative":"project/results.md","autoDesc":true}');export{p as comp,d as data};
