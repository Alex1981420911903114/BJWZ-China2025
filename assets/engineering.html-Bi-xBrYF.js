Introduction</span></a></h2><p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as &quot;persistent chemicals&quot;, are difficult to degrade in the environment and widely present in drinking water and soil. PFAS pose significant hazards to both human health and the ecological environment. Traditional detection relies on large-scale instruments (such as LC-MS), and degradation requires complex conditions like high temperature and high pressure, making it unsuitable for low-cost promotion. This project aims to design a simple and easy-to-operate integrated &quot;detection-degradation&quot; system, which realizes the visual detection and preliminary degradation of PFAS through engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli).</p><h2 id="ii-experimental-materials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ii-experimental-materials"><span>II.

The PFAS-sensing promoter starts the expression of the dehalogenase gene (dhaA) to realize the intracellular defluorination of PFAS, and the GFP intensity can reflect the PFAS degradation in real time. The ion transporter CrcB controlled by the fluoride ion riboswitch is responsible for transporting fluoride ions to the outside of the cell and precipitating with calcium ions. These two systems work together organically to realize the simple integrated detection-degradation requirement of PFAS.

The construction of engineered bacteria provides a new idea for the detection and degradation of PFAS. It innovatively integrates the PFAS detection and degradation systems into one, so that the engineered bacteria can complete the treatment of PFAS by themselves without additional regulation steps. Due to the powerful suicide system and fully controllable mechanism to regulate the expression of target proteins, these modified bacteria are safe enough and will not spread into the environment.
