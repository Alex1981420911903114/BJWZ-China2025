Compared with DhaA, DhaA31’s activity to 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) has been increased by 32 times. Because this enzyme is from Rhodococcus rhodochrous, the original sequence is suitable for expression in prokaryotic cells. However, this sequence is codon-optimized for petunia and is more suitable for plant system. In addition, the N-terminal of the enzyme fused an N-terminal ER-targeting signal peptide which is beneficial to stable protein expression and cell wall localization.</p>',13)])])}const p=t(n,[["render",i]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/project/parts.html","title":"Parts","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Parts I.
